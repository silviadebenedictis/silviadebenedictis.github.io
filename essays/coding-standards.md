## A Lesson Learned

On many occasions, I find myself stuck on a coding project for hours. There are even times when I'm stuck on it for up to two to three days, all because of compilation errors. In the process of being stuck, I go through my messy code several times, run it repeatedly, only to find out that the cause of my error is a missing closing parenthesis. Most of the wasted time could have been avoided if I had followed coding standards because, although it's a minor thing, they are helpful in writing cleaner and more efficient code. Following these guidelines not only makes the code easier to read but also simplifies the process of identifying and fixing bugs.


## A Tale of Varied Styles

Most of the computer science courses that I took had their own style guide that we had to adhere to. For example, in ICS 212, curly brackets needed to have a line of their own, and instead of using the tab key to indent, we had to add four spaces. Meanwhile, in another course, there were stricter rules regarding variable naming, spacing, and even comments. It was frustrating how style guides are not set in stone, and they vary from one course to another and even within organizations. However, when I first started using ESLint, my first impression of it was that itâ€™s like a grammar checker specially made for software engineers. It's simple and efficient, providing us with user-friendly icons like the X mark. Despite the fact that it throws warnings for simple things like spacing, I like how hovering over the red squiggly lines under a code immediately tells me the errors or how to improve the line. It felt like a reliable autocorrect, and there was a sense of satisfaction from seeing the green checkmark, assuring me that my code will at least run.

## Conclusion

Overall, coding standards will differ from place to place, whether you're working in a team or individually. However, it's important to conform to a style guide because it saves time when looking for bugs and removes unneeded guesswork. So, the next time I'm stuck on a project, I will use a reliable code analysis tool like ESLint to conquer the problem.
