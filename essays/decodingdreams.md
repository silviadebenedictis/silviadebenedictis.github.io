## Where it began

During my childhood years, my family owned an old computer, and I can still vividly remember when it started up and displayed the "Microsoft Windows 2000" logo. I would play around with any application that seemed interesting and press random keys until a large black screen popped up. I found it fascinating how just a few lines of text could alter the computer's files—until I got in trouble for accidentally deleting my mother's document.

Years later, in high school, I discovered that it was the command line and was even more curious about it to the point of taking AP Computer Science. It was my first time coding, and there was always some error or issue whenever I worked on a project, but the satisfaction gained from fixing it was always greater than the disappointment. And that’s where it all began.


## The present

After completing several software engineering-related courses, I’m now interested in web and mobile app design. I feel that it suits my passion the most because, in addition to programming, I enjoy engaging in creative pursuits like graphic design. I have gained experience from collaborating on web application development with my team, working on side projects, and class assignments and would like to take part in hackathons as well.

## Where it will go

In the future, I hope to enhance my programming skills. Despite having worked on many projects already, I tend to become too accustomed to using one programming language and then struggle when transitioning to another. I want to solidify my grasp of the fundamentals and become proficient in working on diverse projects. Most importantly, I aspire to successfully deploy my final project by the end of this semester and present it proudly to others.
