Learning Javascript is like learning English, but with a different accent. Let’s say we speak American English and are trying to learn the British accent. The main difference between these two is how certain words are pronounced. The same goes for Javascript and C++, which is the language that I’m used to working with the most. They share some common elements like similar structures for functions, loops, and conditionals but have different syntax, which is something that will take me a while to get used to. However, I think Javascript is a convenient programming language because of its simplicity. We can use functions like variables, or as I recently learned, treat them like “first-class citizens”.

Although I prefer to work in a relaxed environment instead of using the athletic software engineering approach, I think that it will benefit me in the future when I’ll have to step out of my comfort zone and work under pressure. I also found the practice WODs very useful in preparing me for the real ones. They drive me to think faster and improve my efficiency skills.
