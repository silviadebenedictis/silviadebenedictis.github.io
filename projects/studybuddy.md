Study Buddy is a website I created with my team to help college students find study groups based on their major or class. It will prompt the user to enter their information, like their college and class, and connect them to study groups. In order to develop the web app, we used Flask to provide us with the tools and libraries we needed. I was in charge of creating the function to get user data, store it in a database, and post it once the user is matched with a group. I linked it to MongoDB, where the info can be stored so that it can print out a confirmation in the next page.
