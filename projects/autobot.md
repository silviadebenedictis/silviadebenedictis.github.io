Autonomous vehicles and robots are increasingly visible in magazines and news stories. It seems inevitable that they will soon be a major commercial technology. The objective of this project is to use the open-source ROS mapping and navigation stack and devise a way for a mobile robot to quickly and automatically learn the physical map for a house so that it is prepared to carry out domestic activities.

In this project I gained a basic understanding of robot programming and learn about [ROS](https://www.ros.org), one of the principal tools for programming robots. I also researched algorithms for mapping and for robot navigation. While evaluating our team's robot behavior, we successfully managed to make the auto robot wander about 1.6 rooms and trace 2.75 rooms in the span of 5 minutes. 

Our team won first place for our Autonomous Robotics Exploration presentation:
